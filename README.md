Email Client Testing
====================

The varying level of HTML/CSS support in email clients makes the job of an email developer a pain. Luckily there are many testing tools out there that allow you to view your email campaigns in a variety of clients, but what happens when you want to find out the underlying rendering engine and its HTML/CSS support? Unfortunately screenshots won't help you here, but hopefully these email testing templates just might.

These templates have been designed so you can simply copy and paste and send to any email address of your choice, from here the template will give you various information about the email client without you have to do anything (other than send the test of course!)

## Email rendering test

This template aims to test the rendering engine and key areas of the email client, by giving one of two responses:

Green - Indicates a TRUE response to the test
Red - Indicates a FALSE response to the test

## Email ACID test
