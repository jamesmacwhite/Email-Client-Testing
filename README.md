Email Client Testing Templates
====================

The varying level of HTML/CSS support in email clients makes the job of an email developer a pain. Luckily there are many testing tools out there that allow you to test your email campaigns in a variety of clients, but what happens when you want to find out the underlying rendering engine and its HTML/CSS support? Unfortunately screenshots won't help you here (only tell you something isn't right), but this is where these specifically designed email testing templates come in!

These templates have been designed so you can simply copy and paste and send to any email address of your choice, from here the template will give you various information about the email client without you have to do anything (other than send the test of course!)

## Email Rendering Test

This template aims to test the rendering engine and key technical areas of the email client and present that information to the user via a series of test results.

The two possible outcomes of each test will either be a pass or a fail:

* Red Block - Indicates a FAIL in the specified test
* Green Block - Indicates a PASS in the specified test

## Email Acid Test

This template is originally from the [Email Standards Project](http://www.email-standards.org/acid-test), it has been modified with additional tests, including HTML5 and also corrects some minor issues with the original version.

The acid test visually demostrates the HTML/HTML5/CSS support level of the client that is rendered in.
